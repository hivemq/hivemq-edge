# Protocol Adapter FSM Redesign Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the redesign of the Protocol Adapter state management system from an async-heavy,
callback-based architecture to a clean, synchronous FSM-based architecture. The goal is to eliminate the
complexity introduced by CompletableFuture chains, timeouts, and callback listeners while maintaining
full feature parity.

---

## 1. Analysis of Current Design Problems

### 1.1 Async Operation Complexity

The current `ProtocolAdapterWrapper` suffers from:

```mermaid
---
title: "PROBLEM: Nested async operations create unpredictable state transitions"
---
graph TD
    A["startAsync()"] --> B["CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()"]
    B --> C["adapter.start()"]
    C --> D["output.getStartFuture() [Another CompletableFuture]"]
    D --> E[".thenCompose()"]
    E --> F["attemptStartingConsumers()"]
    F --> G["protocolAdapterState.setConnectionStatusListener()"]
    G --> H["[Callback waits 300s timeout]"]
    H --> I["startWritingAsync()"]
    I --> J["[More async]"]
```

**Specific Issues:**

1. **Race Conditions**: The `shuttingDown` flag and `AtomicBoolean futureCompleted` are workarounds for
   async operations completing after stop is initiated.

2. **Timeout Complexity**: A 300-second `ScheduledExecutorService` timeout waits for the adapter to
   reach CONNECTED/STATELESS before enabling writing.

3. **Callback Chaos**: `ConnectionStatusListener` callback must filter initial status, handle multiple
   status types, and coordinate with timeouts.

4. **Unpredictable Transitions**: State changes can happen from any thread at any time, making debugging
   and reasoning about the system difficult.

5. **Error Recovery Complexity**: `stopAfterFailedStart()` must manually clean up polling, writing, and
   call adapter.stop() to handle partial startup failures.

### 1.2 State Dimension Confusion

Current design has **two independent state dimensions**:
- `RuntimeStatus`: STARTED, STOPPED
- `ConnectionStatus`: CONNECTED, DISCONNECTED, STATELESS, UNKNOWN, ERROR, CONNECTING

This creates **ambiguous states** like:
- RuntimeStatus=STARTED + ConnectionStatus=ERROR (Is the adapter running or not?)
- RuntimeStatus=STOPPED + ConnectionStatus=CONNECTED (How can it be connected if stopped?)

### 1.3 Missing State Machine Enforcement

Current design uses `OperationState` enum (IDLE, STARTING, STOPPING) as a guard against concurrent
operations, but it doesn't enforce valid state transitions. Invalid transitions fail silently or
cause unpredictable behavior.

---

## 2. New FSM Design Philosophy

### 2.1 Core Principles

1. **Synchronous by Default**: All state transitions are synchronous. Async operations are pushed to
   the edges (adapter implementation).

2. **Single Source of Truth**: One state machine per component, not multiple state dimensions.

3. **Explicit Transitions**: All valid transitions are defined and enforced by the FSM.

4. **Clear Ownership**:
   - `ProtocolAdapterWrapper2` owns `ProtocolAdapterState` and `ProtocolAdapterConnectionState` (×2: Northbound + Southbound)
   - `ProtocolAdapterManager2` manages the lifecycle of `ProtocolAdapterWrapper2` instances

5. **Separation of Concerns**: The wrapper calls `ProtocolAdapter2.connect()` / `disconnect()`,
   not the other way around.

6. **Optional Southbound Support**: Not all protocol adapters support Southbound communication.
   Adapters that only support Northbound (read-only) do not manage a southbound connection state.

### 2.2 Handling Adapters Without Southbound Support

**Important**: Not all protocol adapters support Southbound (MQTT → Device) communication.

| Adapter Type | Northbound | Southbound |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| OPC UA       | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      |
| Modbus       | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No       |
| HTTP         | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No       |
| File         | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No       |
| S7/ADS       | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No       |
| EtherIP      | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No       |
| MTConnect    | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No       |
| Database     | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No       |

**Design Decision**: For adapters without Southbound support:
- The `southboundConnectionState` remains `Disconnected` (never transitions)
- `startSouthbound()` returns `true` immediately (no-op)
- `stopSouthbound()` returns `true` immediately (no-op)
- The adapter's `supportsSouthbound()` method returns `false`
- When checking "both connections Disconnected", we treat non-existent southbound as Disconnected

```java
// Example: Checking if adapter can transition to Idle
boolean canTransitionToIdle() {
    boolean northboundReady = northboundState.isDisconnected();
    boolean southboundReady = !supportsSouthbound() || southboundState.isDisconnected();
    return northboundReady && southboundReady;
}
```

### 2.3 State Machine Definitions

#### ProtocolAdapterState (Manager Level)

```mermaid
---
title: ProtocolAdapterState
---
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Precheck : start()
    Precheck --> Working : success
    Precheck --> Error : error
    Working --> Stopping : stop()
    Working --> Error : non-recoverable error
    Stopping --> Idle : success (both connections disconnected)
    Error --> Idle : reset/retry
```

Valid Transitions:
- Idle → Precheck (start called)
- Precheck → Working (precheck success)
- Precheck → Error (precheck failed)
- Working → Stopping (stop called)
- Working → Error (non-recoverable error)
- Stopping → Idle (both connections disconnected)
- Error → Idle (reset/retry)

#### ProtocolAdapterConnectionState (Wrapper Level, ×2)

```mermaid
---
title: ProtocolAdapterConnectionState
---
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Disconnected
    Disconnected --> Connecting : connect()
    Connecting --> Connected : success
    Connecting --> Error : connection failed
    Connecting --> Disconnecting : abort
    Connected --> Error : connection lost
    Connected --> Disconnecting : graceful stop / disconnect()
    Error --> Disconnecting : cleanup / disconnect()
    Disconnecting --> Disconnected : cleanup complete
```

Valid Transitions:
- Disconnected → Connecting
- Connecting → Connected (success)
- Connecting → Error (connection failed)
- Connecting → Disconnecting (abort)
- Connected → Error (connection lost)
- Connected → Disconnecting (graceful stop)
- Error → Disconnecting (cleanup)
- Disconnecting → Disconnected (cleanup complete)

## 3. Component Redesign

### 3.1 ProtocolAdapter2 Interface

Create a new interface that separates concerns more clearly:

```java
/**
 * ProtocolAdapter2 - Simplified protocol adapter interface
 *
 * Key differences from ProtocolAdapter:
 * 1. connect() returns synchronously or throws - no CompletableFuture
 * 2. disconnect() returns synchronously or throws - no CompletableFuture
 * 3. Connection state is managed by the caller (ProtocolAdapterWrapper2)
 * 4. Adapter should NOT manage its own state
 */
public interface ProtocolAdapter2 {

    /**
     * Get the adapter's unique identifier.
     */
    @NotNull String getId();

    /**
     * Get adapter information (protocol type, capabilities, etc.)
     */
    @NotNull ProtocolAdapterInformation getProtocolAdapterInformation();

    /**
     * Check if this adapter supports Southbound (MQTT → Device) communication.
     *
     * @return true if southbound is supported, false if this is a read-only adapter
     */
    default boolean supportsSouthbound() {
        return false;  // Default: northbound only
    }

    /**
     * Validate configuration before connecting.
     * Called during Precheck phase.
     *
     * @throws ProtocolAdapterException if configuration is invalid
     */
    void precheck() throws ProtocolAdapterException;

    /**
     * Establish connection to the device/service.
     * Called for BOTH northbound and southbound connections.
     *
     * This method should:
     * - Establish the physical/logical connection
     * - Validate connectivity (handshake, auth, etc.)
     * - Return when connection is ready
     * - Throw on any failure
     *
     * The connection type (northbound vs southbound) is determined by
     * the ConnectionContext parameter.
     *
     * @param context Contains connection direction and configuration
     * @throws ProtocolAdapterException on connection failure
     */
    void connect(@NotNull ConnectionContext context) throws ProtocolAdapterException;

    /**
     * Disconnect from the device/service.
     *
     * This method should:
     * - Gracefully close the connection
     * - Release resources
     * - Return when cleanup is complete
     * - NOT throw on failure (log errors instead)
     *
     * @param context Contains connection direction and configuration
     */
    void disconnect(@NotNull ConnectionContext context);

    /**
     * Destroy the adapter instance.
     * Called after both connections are disconnected.
     * Release ALL resources including configuration.
     */
    void destroy();

    /**
     * Poll data from device (for PollingProtocolAdapter implementations).
     * Called by the polling service when adapter is in Connected state.
     */
    default void poll(@NotNull PollingInput input, @NotNull PollingOutput output) {
        output.notSupported();
    }

    /**
     * Write data to device (for WritingProtocolAdapter implementations).
     * Called by the writing service when adapter is in Connected state.
     */
    default void write(@NotNull WritingInput input, @NotNull WritingOutput output) {
        output.notSupported();
    }

    /**
     * Discover available tags/addresses on the device.
     */
    default void discover(@NotNull DiscoveryInput input, @NotNull DiscoveryOutput output) {
        output.notSupported();
    }
}

/**
 * Context provided during connect/disconnect operations
 */
public interface ConnectionContext {
    enum Direction { NORTHBOUND, SOUTHBOUND }

    @NotNull Direction getDirection();
    @NotNull ModuleServices getModuleServices();
    @NotNull List<? extends Tag> getTags();
    @NotNull List<NorthboundMapping> getNorthboundMappings();  // Only for NORTHBOUND
    @NotNull List<SouthboundMapping> getSouthboundMappings();  // Only for SOUTHBOUND
}
```

### 3.2 ProtocolAdapterWrapper2 Redesign

> **Current Implementation Status**: A basic `ProtocolAdapterWrapper2` has been implemented with
> FSM-based state management, synchronized transitions, and start/stop lifecycle methods.
> It currently uses the existing `ProtocolAdapter` SDK interface (not `ProtocolAdapter2` which is
> Phase 2 work). The current implementation does not yet include adapter precheck calls,
> polling/writing/tag manager integration, southbound capability checks, or state change listeners.
> These are planned for Phase 3. The code below shows the **target design** for the completed wrapper.

#### 3.2.1 Async Operation Coordination

The Web UI calls start/stop via REST API which expects async responses. The FSM state
transitions themselves provide atomicity and conflict detection:

```mermaid
---
title: FSM-Based Operation Coordination
---
graph LR
    subgraph "start() called"
        A1[Idle] -->|"✓ VALID"| A2[Precheck] --> A3[Working]
    end

    subgraph "stop() called while in Precheck"
        B1[Precheck] -->|"✗ INVALID<br/>FSM rejects"| B2[Stopping]
    end

    subgraph "stop() called while in Working"
        C1[Working] -->|"✓ VALID"| C2[Stopping] --> C3[Idle]
    end

    subgraph "start() called while in Stopping"
        D1[Stopping] -->|"✗ INVALID<br/>FSM rejects"| D2[Precheck]
    end

    subgraph "start() called while in Precheck/Working"
        E1[Precheck/Working] -->|"✗ INVALID<br/>FSM rejects"| E2[Precheck]
    end

    style B2 stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    style D2 stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    style E2 stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

**Key behaviors:**
| Current State | start() called | stop() called |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Idle          | → Precheck ✓   | FSM rejects (no transition) |
| Precheck      | FSM rejects    | FSM rejects (no transition) |
| Working       | FSM rejects    | → Stopping ✓  |
| Stopping      | FSM rejects    | FSM rejects (already stopping) |
| Error         | FSM rejects    | → Idle ✓ (cleanup) |

The `synchronized` keyword on `start()` and `stop()` ensures only one thread executes
at a time. The FSM transition response tells the caller whether the operation succeeded.

**Async wrapper is simple:**
```java
// In ProtocolAdapterManager2
public CompletableFuture<Boolean> startAsync(String adapterId) {
    return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        ProtocolAdapterWrapper2 wrapper = getWrapper(adapterId);
        return wrapper.start();  // FSM handles conflicts
    });
}

public CompletableFuture<Boolean> stopAsync(String adapterId, boolean destroy) {
    return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        ProtocolAdapterWrapper2 wrapper = getWrapper(adapterId);
        return wrapper.stop(destroy);  // FSM handles conflicts
    });
}
```

```java
/**
 * ProtocolAdapterWrapper2 - Manages adapter lifecycle and connection states
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * 1. Owns ProtocolAdapterState and both ProtocolAdapterConnectionState instances
 * 2. Coordinates transitions between states
 * 3. Calls ProtocolAdapter2 methods synchronously
 * 4. Reports state changes to listeners
 *
 * Threading Model:
 * - All state transitions are synchronized
 * - connect/disconnect operations run on caller's thread
 * - State change notifications are asynchronous (fire-and-forget)

### 3.3 ProtocolAdapterManager2 Redesign

> **Current Implementation Status**: `ProtocolAdapterManager2` has been implemented with full
> CRUD operations, factory integration (`ProtocolAdapterFactoryManager`), parallel refresh using
> `CompletableFuture.allOf()`, event service and metrics integration, ClassLoader management
> (`ClassLoaderUtils`), I18n error messages (`I18nProtocolAdapterMessage`), and consumer registration
> with `ProtocolAdapterExtractor`. The start/stop methods delegate synchronously to `ProtocolAdapterWrapper2`
> and throw `ProtocolAdapterException` on failure. The code below shows the **target design** for the
> completed manager; the current implementation already exceeds this baseline with parallel refresh
> and full service integration.

```java
/**
 * ProtocolAdapterManager2 - Manages all adapter instances
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * 1. Create/delete adapter instances
 * 2. Coordinate start/stop operations
 * 3. Handle configuration refresh
 * 4. Provide thread-safe access to adapters
 *
 * Threading Model:
 * - ConcurrentHashMap provides thread-safe access to adapter map
 * - Start/stop operations are synchronized per adapter (via wrapper)
 * - Refresh operations run on dedicated single-thread executor
 * - Compound operations (check-then-act) use computeIfAbsent/computeIfPresent
 */

## 4. Async Operation Reduction Strategy

### 4.1 What Changes

| Operation         | Old Design                             | New Design                                         |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `adapter.start()` | Returns `CompletableFuture` via output | `adapter.connect()` - synchronous, throws on error |
| `adapter.stop()`  | Returns `CompletableFuture` via output | `adapter.disconnect()` - synchronous, logs errors  |
| Writing startup   | 300s timeout waiting for CONNECTED     | `startSouthbound()` - synchronous, fails fast      |
| State transitions | Via callbacks and listeners            | Direct method calls on wrapper                     |
| Polling startup   | After async start completes            | After `start()` returns successfully               |

### 4.2 Handling Inherently Async Operations

Some operations are inherently async (network I/O, device communication). These are handled by:

1. **Connection Timeout in Adapter**: Each adapter implementation sets its own timeout for `connect()`.
   The method blocks until connected or timeout, then throws `ProtocolAdapterException`.

2. **Polling Remains Async**: Polling runs on scheduled threads but is controlled synchronously:
   - `startPolling()` registers with `PollingService`
   - `stopPolling()` unregisters immediately

3. **Writing Remains Async**: Writing callbacks are event-driven:
   - `startWriting()` registers contexts with `WritingService`
   - `stopWriting()` unregisters immediately
   - Actual writes happen asynchronously but wrapper state is already Connected

### 4.3 Adapter Implementation Responsibility

Adapter implementations must handle their own async operations internally:

```java
// Example: OPC UA Adapter connect() implementation
@Override
public void connect(ConnectionContext context) throws ProtocolAdapterException {
    try {
        // Create OPC UA client
        client = OpcUaClient.create(endpointUrl, ...);

        // Synchronous connect with timeout
        client.connect().get(connectTimeout, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        // Connection established - return
    } catch (TimeoutException e) {
        throw new ProtocolAdapterException("Connection timeout", e);
    } catch (ExecutionException e) {
        throw new ProtocolAdapterException("Connection failed", e.getCause());
    }
}
```

## 6. Test Strategy

### 6.1 Existing Tests Must Pass

The following tests must continue to pass throughout migration:

```
com.hivemq.protocols.fsm.ProtocolAdapterConnectionStateTest
com.hivemq.protocols.fsm.ProtocolAdapterStateTest
com.hivemq.protocols.fsm.ProtocolAdapterWrapperTest
```

### 6.2 New Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: FSM transition tests (existing)
2. **Component Tests**: Wrapper and Manager tests with mocks
3. **Integration Tests**: Full adapter lifecycle with real services
4. **Stress Tests**: Concurrent start/stop operations
5. **Error Recovery Tests**: Failure scenarios and recovery

### 6.3 Test Isolation

Until switchover:
- New code lives in `com.hivemq.protocols.fsm` package
- Old code remains in `com.hivemq.protocols` package
- Tests don't interfere with production code
- Feature flag controls which implementation is used

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                           | Impact | Mitigation                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Adapter implementations rely on async patterns | High   | Use bridge pattern or migrate incrementally  |
| State transition timing changes                | Medium | Thorough integration testing                 |
| Performance regression                         | Medium | Benchmark before/after                       |
| Hidden dependencies on callbacks               | Medium | Code review all adapter implementations      |
| Concurrent operation handling                  | High   | Use proper synchronization, add stress tests |

---

## 8. Success Criteria

1. All existing FSM tests pass
2. All adapter types can start/stop successfully
3. State transitions are deterministic and traceable
4. Error recovery works correctly
5. No performance regression (< 5% slower startup)
6. Code complexity reduced (fewer callbacks, no nested futures)
7. Easier to debug and reason about

---

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Adapter Migration Strategy**: Should we:
   - (A) Create new `ProtocolAdapter2` implementations for each adapter?
   - (B) Use a bridge pattern to wrap existing adapters?
   - (C) Modify existing adapters to support both interfaces?

   **Recommendation**: Option (B) for initial migration, then (A) for new adapters.

2. **Connection Timeout Configuration**: Should timeout be:
   - (A) Configured per-adapter in adapter config?
   - (B) Global default with per-adapter override?
   - (C) Hardcoded per adapter type?

   **Recommendation**: Option (B) with sensible defaults.

3. **Error State Recovery**: Should error state:
   - (A) Require manual intervention (stop + start)?
   - (B) Support automatic retry with backoff?
   - (C) Transition directly to retry (Connecting)?

   **Recommendation**: Option (A) for simplicity, with option for (B) in future.
