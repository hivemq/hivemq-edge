/**
 *
 * The reason we need this is for ChakraProvider styling in Playground.
 * The User Developer would be responsible for styling with ChakraProvider in their app.
 *
 * Exact duplicate of `@chakra-ui/react`'s `CSSReset` component. Except for the following:
 *
  ```css
    input {
      border-width: revert;
      border-color: revert;
      border-style: revert;
    }
    .array-item > hr {
      margin-top: 16px;
      margin-bottom: 16px;
    }
  ```

  It is located at the bottom of the styles string.
