# Cypress ESLint Plugin - Flat Config

 Please refer to the [README](./README.md) document where the previous contents of this document, describing how to use `eslint-plugin-cypress` with an ESLint `v9` (default) [flat configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files), can now be found.

For instructions on using a deprecated [eslintrc-type](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-deprecated) config file from previous ESLint `v8` versions and below, please refer to the [ESLINTRC-CONFIG](./ESLINTRC-CONFIG.md) document.
