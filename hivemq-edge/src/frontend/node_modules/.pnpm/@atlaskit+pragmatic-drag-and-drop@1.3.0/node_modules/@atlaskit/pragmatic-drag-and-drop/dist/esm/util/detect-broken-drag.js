  // ## Detecting drag ending for removed draggables
  //
  // If a draggable element is removed during a drag and the user drops:
  // 1. if over a valid drop target: we get a "drop" event to know the drag is finished
  // 2. if not over a valid drop target (or cancelled): we get nothing
  // The "dragend" event will not fire on the source draggable if it has been
  // removed from the DOM.
  // So we need to figure out if a drag operation has finished by looking at other events
  // We can do this by looking at other events

  // ### First detection: "pointermove" events

  // 1. "pointermove" events cannot fire during a drag and drop operation
  // according to the spec. So if we get a "pointermove" it means that
  // the drag and drop operations has finished. So if we get a "pointermove"
  // we know that the drag is over
  // 2. ðŸ¦ŠðŸ˜¤ Drag and drop operations are _supposed_ to suppress
  // other pointer events. However, firefox will allow a few
  // pointer event to get through after a drag starts.
  // The most I've seen is 3

          return;
        }
        onDragEnd();
      };
    }()
  },
  // ### Second detection: "pointerdown" events

  // If we receive this event then we know that a drag operation has finished
  // and potentially another one is about to start.
  // Note: `pointerdown` fires on all browsers / platforms before "dragstart"
