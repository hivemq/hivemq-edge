# Pull Request: Duplicate Combiner Detection Enhancement

**Kanban Ticket:** https://businessmap.io/c/57/33168

---

## Description

# Pull Request Template & Guidelines

**Purpose:** This template provides structure and guidelines for creating effective, UX-focused pull request descriptions.

---

## Quick Start

1. Copy the [Basic Template](#basic-template) section below
2. Replace placeholders with your content
3. Follow the [Writing Guidelines](#writing-guidelines)
4. Include screenshots from Cypress E2E tests
5. Focus on **user benefits**, not technical implementation details

---

## Writing Guidelines

### Audience & Tone

**Primary Audience:** Product managers, designers, and other developers (not just technical reviewers)

**Tone:**

- ‚úÖ **User-centric**: Start with what users gain
- ‚úÖ **Clear & concise**: Avoid unnecessary technical jargon
- ‚úÖ **Visual**: Use screenshots and examples liberally
- ‚úÖ **Action-oriented**: Focus on benefits and outcomes
- ‚ùå **Avoid**: Code snippets in description (save for "Files Changed")
- ‚ùå **Avoid**: Replicating GitHub ticket details
- ‚ùå **Avoid**: Overly technical implementation minutiae

### Description Section

**Purpose:** Explain the "what" and "why" from a user perspective.

**Structure:**

1. **Opening paragraph**: Transform statement - what changes for users?
2. **Enhancement list**: 3-5 bullet points of key improvements
3. **User benefits subsection**: What users gain (not how it works)
4. **Technical summary**: Brief 3-5 bullet points for developers

**Example (Good):**

```markdown
This PR transforms how users understand the state of their data pipelines.
Previously, users could only see if nodes were connected. Now, users can
instantly see both runtime status (is it connected?) and operational status
(is it configured?) through intuitive visual feedback.
```

**Example (Bad - Too Technical):**

```markdown
This PR implements a dual-status model with Runtime and Operational enums,
refactors 10 node components to use the new NodeStatusModel interface, and
adds edge-specific status computation using React Flow hooks.
```

### BEFORE/AFTER Sections

**Purpose:** Show the transformation visually and concisely.

**BEFORE - Structure:**

- Brief description of limitations
- 3-5 bullet points of problems/limitations
- Optional: Screenshot (if available)
- No need for lengthy explanations

**AFTER - Structure:**

- Subsections for each major improvement (2-4 subsections)
- **Screenshot first**, explanation second
- Screenshot captions should reference Cypress test files
- Include viewport size in captions (e.g., "1400x1016")
- **Key Visual Elements** bullet list after each screenshot
- **User Benefits** paragraph explaining value

**Screenshot Guidelines:**

- Use Cypress E2E tests to capture consistent screenshots
- Reference the test file in caption: `_Test: cypress/e2e/[path]/[file].spec.cy.ts_`
- Include scenario description: `_Scenario: User creates adapter with multiple combiners_`
- Use consistent viewport: 1400x1016 (or document if different)
- Save in `.tasks/[task-id]/screenshots/` directory
- Use descriptive filenames: `after-modal-empty-state.png`

### Visual Language Guide (Optional)

**When to include:** For features with visual/UI changes

**Structure:**

- Table format for clarity
- Three columns: Visual Element | Meaning | User Action
- Use emojis for quick recognition (üü¢üî¥üü°‚ö°üö´)
- Include "Combined Status Examples" table showing interactions

### Test Coverage Section

**Keep it high-level:**

- Total count (e.g., "74+ tests, all passing ‚úÖ")
- Breakdown by type (unit, integration, E2E)
- Brief description of what each type covers
- Mention visual regression tools (Percy, Cypress screenshots)

**Avoid:**

- Listing every test file
- Showing test code
- Overly detailed test descriptions

### Files Changed Section

**Structure:**

- **Summary table** with counts (Created/Modified/Total)
- **Key Files** organized by category
- Brief one-line descriptions
- File paths for easy navigation

**Keep concise:**

- Group similar files (e.g., "All 10 node types")
- Don't list every single file
- Focus on most important/changed files

### Standard Sections

Always include these sections (brief is fine):

1. **Breaking Changes** - List or state "None"
2. **Performance Impact** - Positive improvements or "No impact"
3. **Accessibility** - Key a11y considerations (if UI changes)
4. **Documentation** - What docs were added/updated

### Reviewer Notes Section

**Purpose:** Help reviewers know what to focus on and how to test.

**Structure:**

1. **Focus areas** (4-5 bullet points)
2. **Manual testing suggestions** (step-by-step)
3. **Quick test commands** (code block)

**Be specific:**

- What should reviewers pay attention to?
- How can they reproduce key scenarios?
- What commands run the relevant tests?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Too Technical

**Bad:**

```markdown
This PR implements a NodeStatusModel interface with Runtime and Operational
enums, refactors 10 node components to use React.useMemo for status
computation, and adds per-edge operational status logic using the target
node's statusModel.operational property.
```

**Good:**

```markdown
This PR transforms how users see their workspace status. Users can now
instantly see both if nodes are connected (runtime) and if they're
configured correctly (operational) through color and animation.
```

### ‚ùå Replicating GitHub Ticket

**Bad:**

- Copying entire ticket description
- Listing all acceptance criteria
- Including internal planning notes
- Lengthy requirement specifications

**Good:**

- Brief user-focused description
- Link to ticket for details
- Focus on what was actually built

### ‚ùå Missing Visuals

**Bad:**

- All text, no screenshots
- Generic descriptions of UI changes
- "The modal looks better now"

**Good:**

- Screenshot for every UI change
- Annotated with captions
- Referenced test file for reproducibility

### ‚ùå Code Dumps

**Bad:**

- Long code snippets in description
- Showing implementation details
- Technical architecture diagrams

**Good:**

- Save code for "Files Changed" section
- Focus on user-facing behavior
- Use simple diagrams if needed (tables work well)

### ‚ùå Vague Benefits

**Bad:**

- "Improved UX"
- "Better performance"
- "Enhanced usability"

**Good:**

- "Faster troubleshooting: Immediately identify which connections need attention"
- "Reduced configuration errors: Visual feedback prevents incomplete setups"

## Questions?

**For PR description questions:**

- Review this template
- Look at recent PRs for examples
- Ask in team chat

**For technical implementation questions:**

- Those belong in code comments
- Or in architecture documentation
- Not in the PR description

---

**Remember:** The PR description is for understanding **user value and testing the change**, not for explaining **how the code works**. Save implementation details for code review discussions and documentation.
