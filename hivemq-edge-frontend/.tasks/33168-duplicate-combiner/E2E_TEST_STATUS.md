# E2E Test Fixes - Phase 3 Update

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** Partial Success - 6/12 tests passing

---

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. TypeScript Errors
- Fixed `EntityReference` property name (`identifier` → `id`)
- Removed unused `COMBINER_ID_1` variable
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved

### 2. ESLint Warnings
- Removed unused `cy.as()` aliases
- All ESLint validations passing

### 3. Translation Text Mismatches
Fixed test assertions to match actual translations in `src/locales/en/translation.json`:

| Element | Original (Wrong) | Fixed (Correct) |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Modal Title | "Combiner Already Exists" | "Possible Duplicate Combiner" |
| Description | "A combiner with these exact sources already exists" | "A combiner with the same source connections already exists" |
| Prompt | "Would you like to use the existing combiner" | "What would you like to do?" |

## Current Test Status

### ✅ Passing Tests (6/12)
1. should close modal when cancel button is clicked
2. should close modal when X button is clicked
3. should navigate to existing combiner when "Use Existing" is clicked
4. should close modal when ESC is pressed
5. should focus "Use Existing" button by default
6. should be accessible (Percy test)

### ❌ Failing Tests (6/12)
1. should show duplicate modal when creating combiner with same sources
2. should display correct modal content for combiner
3. should create new combiner when "Create New Anyway" is clicked
4. should display existing mappings in modal
5. should show empty state when combiner has no mappings
6. should be accessible with mappings (Percy test)

---

## Analysis

**Pattern Observed:**
- **Basic interaction tests are passing** (close, navigate, keyboard, focus)
- **Complex workflow tests are failing** (duplicate detection, mappings display)

**Likely Causes:**
The failing tests all involve:
1. Creating an initial combiner
2. Attempting to create a duplicate
3. Verifying the modal appears with correct content

This suggests the issue is with the **duplicate detection flow** itself, not the modal component.

---

## Next Steps to Investigate

### 1. Check Duplicate Detection Logic
The tests create a combiner, then try to create another with the same sources. The modal should appear, but it may not be triggering correctly.

**Possible issues:**
- MSW database not persisting between combiner creations
- Duplicate detection logic not finding the existing combiner
- Timing issues with API calls

### 2. Verify Test Data
- Ensure the mock combiner data has the correct structure
- Verify EntityReference IDs match between creations
- Check that `findExistingCombiner` utility is working in E2E context

### 3. Add Debug Logging
Add `cy.log()` statements to see:
- What combiners exist after first creation
- What sources are being sent on second creation
- Whether duplicate is actually detected

## Recommendations

Given the 50% pass rate and the pattern of failures, I recommend:

1. **Focus on the 6 passing tests** as a solid foundation for Phase 3 completion
2. **File the 6 failing tests as known issues** with detailed investigation notes
3. **Update task documentation** to reflect partial completion with specific blockers
4. **Create follow-up task** to debug and fix the duplicate detection flow in E2E context

The component tests (Phase 2) are 100% passing, which validates the modal functionality works correctly. The E2E failures appear to be related to test setup/mocking rather than the actual feature.
