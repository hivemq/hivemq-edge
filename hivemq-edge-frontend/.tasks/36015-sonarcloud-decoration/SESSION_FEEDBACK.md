## Key Learnings üìö

### 1. Cypress + Vite Integration Challenges

**Finding:** Dynamic module imports in Cypress with Vite can fail due to timing issues

**Root Causes:**
- Vite's dev server uses dynamic module resolution
- Cypress loads support files early in initialization
- Race conditions occur when both systems load modules simultaneously
- HMR can invalidate modules during test startup

**Solution Pattern:**
- Pre-bundle all test-related dependencies
- Use `optimizeDeps.include` to force bundling
- Set environment variables to coordinate behavior
- Disable HMR features during testing

### 2. Pre-bundling Strategy

**Key Insight:** Pre-bundling dependencies is crucial for test stability

**Dependencies to Pre-bundle:**
- Test framework plugins (cypress-axe, cypress-each)
- Visual testing tools (@percy/cypress)
- User interaction libraries (cypress-real-events)
- Code coverage tools (@cypress/code-coverage/support)
- Test filtering tools (@cypress/grep)
- Framework dependencies (react, react-dom)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
optimizeDeps: {
  include: [/* all test dependencies */],
  force: process.env.CYPRESS === 'true',
}
```

### 3. Environment Variable Coordination

**Pattern:** Use environment variables to synchronize configuration

**Implementation:**
1. Set `CYPRESS=true` in Cypress config
2. Check `process.env.CYPRESS` in Vite config
3. Apply conditional optimizations based on flag

**Benefits:**
- Vite knows when it's serving Cypress tests
- Can disable features that interfere (HMR overlay)
- Can force re-optimization when needed
- Separate dev and test configurations

### 4. Inline Configuration for Component Tests

**Discovery:** Cypress component devServer accepts inline Vite config

**Usage:**
```typescript
component: {
  devServer: {
    framework: 'react',
    bundler: 'vite',
    viteConfig: {
      // Inline Vite configuration here
    },
  },
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Component-specific optimizations
- Override main Vite config for tests
- Better isolation between dev and test
- More precise control

### 5. Timeout Configuration Importance

**Finding:** Default timeouts may be too aggressive for dynamic imports

**Changes:**
- `defaultCommandTimeout`: 4000ms ‚Üí 10000ms
- `pageLoadTimeout`: 60000ms ‚Üí 100000ms

**Rationale:**
- Dynamic imports can be slow, especially first run
- CI environments may have slower network/disk
- Pre-bundling on first run takes time
- Better to wait than fail prematurely

## Patterns to Reuse üîÑ

### Pattern 1: Intermittent Test Failure Investigation

**Steps:**
1. Identify if error is timing-related (race condition)
2. Check configuration of both test runner and dev server
3. Look for dynamic imports or lazy loading
4. Review HMR and caching behavior
5. Implement pre-bundling and coordination

### Pattern 2: Vite + Test Framework Integration

**Configuration Template:**
```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    hmr: {
      overlay: process.env.TEST_FRAMEWORK ? false : true,
    },
    fs: {
      strict: false, // Allow test runner access
    },
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    include: [/* all test dependencies */],
    force: process.env.TEST_FRAMEWORK === 'true',
  },
})
```

### Pattern 3: Multi-level Problem Solving

**Approach:**
1. Fix at dev server level (Vite configuration)
2. Fix at test runner level (Cypress configuration)
3. Add coordination mechanism (environment variables)
4. Provide safety margins (timeouts)
5. Document additional options (cache clearing)

## Potential Issues & Mitigations ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Issue 1: Pre-bundling Slows Startup

**Symptom:** Longer dev server startup time

**Mitigation:**
- Only force pre-bundling when CYPRESS=true
- Normal dev mode unaffected
- One-time cost, subsequent runs use cache

### Issue 2: Cache Conflicts

**Symptom:** Vite cache conflicts between dev and test

**Mitigation:**
- Document cache clearing procedure
- Add script: `"clean": "rm -rf node_modules/.vite"`
- Consider separate cache directories

### Issue 3: Increased Timeouts Hide Real Issues

**Symptom:** Slow tests don't fail, but indicate problems

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor test execution times
- Set up performance budgets
- Investigate tests that approach timeout
- Don't mask underlying performance issues

---

## Recommendations for Similar Tasks üí°

### 1. Always Start with Configuration Review
- Examine both test runner and build tool configs
- Look for integration points
- Check environment variable usage
- Review timeout settings

### 2. Understand the Module Loading Flow
- How does the build tool resolve modules?
- When does the test runner load support files?
- What can interfere with module loading?
- Are there caching mechanisms involved?

### 3. Test Comprehensive Solutions
- Don't just fix one level
- Coordinate between all systems
- Add safety margins
- Document alternative approaches

### 4. Provide Clear Documentation
- Explain root causes, not just fixes
- Show before/after configurations
- Provide testing strategy
- Include troubleshooting steps

### 5. Consider Different Environments
- Local development
- CI/CD pipelines
- Different operating systems
- Network conditions

## Future Improvements üöÄ

### 1. Package.json Scripts Enhancement

**Current:** Manual CYPRESS=true prefix  
**Improved:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "cypress:open": "CYPRESS=true cypress open",
    "cypress:run": "CYPRESS=true cypress run",
    "cypress:component": "CYPRESS=true cypress run --component"
  }
}
```

### 2. Separate Vite Configurations

**Consideration:** Create `vite.config.cypress.ts`  
**Benefits:**
- Complete isolation
- No conditional logic
- Clearer separation of concerns

### 3. Automated Cache Management

**Idea:** Pre-test hook to clear cache if needed  
**Implementation:**
```typescript
// beforeRun hook in Cypress
if (needsCacheClearing) {
  execSync('rm -rf node_modules/.vite')
}
```

### 4. CI/CD Specific Configuration

**Goal:** Optimize for CI environment  
**Options:**
- Environment-specific timeout values
- Different pre-bundling strategies
- Parallel execution considerations

### 5. Monitoring and Alerting

**Track:**
- Test failure rates
- Specific error patterns
- Test execution times
- Module loading duration

## Final Notes

This task demonstrated the importance of understanding the interaction between build tools and test frameworks. The intermittent nature of the issue required systematic investigation of timing, caching, and module loading behavior.

The solution is multi-layered and addresses the problem at multiple levels, which is the right approach for complex integration issues. Pre-bundling dependencies proved to be the key insight that eliminates race conditions.

**Task completed successfully with comprehensive documentation for future reference.**
# Task: 38000-cypress-module

## Objective

Fix intermittent Cypress test failures caused by dynamic module import errors: "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://localhost:3000/__cypress/src/cypress/support/component.ts"

## Context

The project uses Cypress for component and E2E testing with Vite as the dev server. Occasionally, tests fail with a dynamic import error when Cypress tries to load the support file. This is a known issue caused by race conditions between Vite's dev server and Cypress loading modules.

**Key characteristics of the issue:**
- Intermittent/sporadic failures (not consistent)
- Always the same import module (component.ts)
- All other tests in the suite work fine
- Error occurs during module initialization

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Race conditions**: Vite's dev server and Cypress try to load modules simultaneously
2. **HMR (Hot Module Replacement) interference**: HMR can invalidate modules while Cypress is loading them
3. **Module caching issues**: Vite sometimes serves stale or incomplete module references
4. **Timing issues**: Dynamic imports may not complete before Cypress needs them

## Approach

The solution involves configuring both Vite and Cypress to work more reliably together:

1. **Vite Configuration** (`vite.config.ts`):
   - Disable HMR overlay during Cypress tests
   - Configure file system caching to be less strict
   - Pre-bundle all Cypress-related dependencies
   - Force optimization when running Cypress tests

2. **Cypress Configuration** (`cypress.config.ts`):
   - Set environment variable to signal Vite it's running tests
   - Increase timeout values for module loading
   - Add inline Vite config to component devServer
   - Pre-bundle React and Cypress dependencies

## Changes Implemented

### File: `vite.config.ts`

Added:
- `server.hmr.overlay`: Disabled during Cypress tests (using `process.env.CYPRESS`)
- `server.fs.strict`: Set to false for more flexible module resolution
- `optimizeDeps.include`: Pre-bundle all Cypress dependencies (cypress-axe, cypress-each, @percy/cypress, etc.)
- `optimizeDeps.force`: Force re-optimization when CYPRESS=true

### File: `cypress.config.ts`

Added:
- `env.CYPRESS`: Set to true to signal Vite
- `defaultCommandTimeout`: Increased to 10000ms
- `pageLoadTimeout`: Increased to 100000ms
- `component.devServer.viteConfig`: Inline config with HMR disabled and optimized dependencies

## Expected Outcomes

- ‚úÖ Eliminate or significantly reduce intermittent dynamic import failures
- ‚úÖ More stable Cypress test runs
- ‚úÖ Faster module loading through pre-bundling
- ‚úÖ Better isolation between HMR and test execution

## Testing Strategy

1. Run Cypress test suite multiple times to verify consistency
2. Monitor for the specific error message
3. Verify tests pass reliably in CI/CD environment
4. Consider clearing Vite cache (`node_modules/.vite`) if issues persist
