# Subtask 1: Simple Test Mock Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary

Fixed 16 TypeScript errors related to test mocks by adding proper return type to the `useGetCombinedEntities` hook and adding missing properties to test fixtures.

## Root Cause Analysis

All UseQueryResult-related errors (13 out of 16) were caused by the same issue: the `useGetCombinedEntities` hook was returning `UseQueryResult<unknown, Error>[]` instead of the properly typed `UseQueryResult<DomainTagList | TopicFilterList, Error>[]`.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/api/hooks/useDomainModel/useGetCombinedEntities.ts` ⭐ PRIMARY FIX

**Errors fixed:** 13 (across 3 test files)
**Issue:** Hook had no explicit return type, causing TypeScript to infer `unknown` for query results
**Solution:** Added explicit return type to the hook function

```typescript
import type { QueryFunction, QueryKey, UseQueryResult } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import type { DomainTagList, EntityReference, TopicFilterList } from '@/api/__generated__'

export const useGetCombinedEntities = (
  entities: EntityReference[]
): UseQueryResult<DomainTagList | TopicFilterList, Error>[] => {
  // ...existing implementation
}
```

**Lines affected:** 1-10 (imports and function signature)

**Impact:** This single change fixed errors in:

- `src/modules/Mappings/hooks/useValidateCombiner.spec.ts` (11 errors)
- `src/modules/Mappings/combiner/CombinedEntitySelect.spec.cy.tsx` (1 error)
- `src/modules/Mappings/combiner/components/AutoMapping.spec.cy.tsx` (1 error)

### 2. `src/modules/Workspace/components/filters/ConfigurationSave.spec.cy.tsx`

**Errors fixed:** 3
**Issue:** Missing required `isActive` property in `FilterConfigurationOption` test mocks
**Solution:** Added `isActive: false` to all mock configuration objects

```typescript
// Line 34-35
{ label: 'test1', filter: {}, isActive: false },
{ label: 'test2', filter: {}, isActive: false },

// Line 79
{ label: 'my first quick filter', filter: {}, isActive: false }
```

**Lines affected:** 34, 35, 79

## Design Decision

**Initial approach:** Add type assertions at each call site (3 files)  
**Better approach:** Fix the type at the source (1 file) ✅

By adding the return type directly to the `useGetCombinedEntities` hook, we:

- Fixed all 13 related errors with a single change
- Improved type safety for all future uses of the hook
- Eliminated the need for repetitive type assertions
- Made the code more maintainable

---

## Verification

✅ All 16 errors resolved  
✅ TypeScript compilation passes (`npx tsc --noEmit` returns no errors)  
✅ No new TypeScript errors introduced  
✅ Type safety improved at the source

## Testing Status

- No functional changes to test behavior
- Existing test logic unchanged
- Type assertions removed (no longer needed)

---

## Note on Premature Completion

Initial verification was incorrect - claimed all errors were resolved when only Subtask 1 was complete. This was due to using wrong tsc command (`npx tsc --noEmit` vs `npx tsc -b`).

**Learning:** Always use the same command the user uses for verification.

**Actual Status after Subtask 1:**

- ✅ 16 errors fixed
- ⏳ 8 errors remaining (from original 24)

---

**Status:** COMPLETED ✅  
**Errors at start:** 24  
**Errors remaining:** 8 (Subtask 2, 3, and 4)  
**Next:** Subtask 2 - React Flow Node Type Fixes
