# Conversation: Task 25337 - Workspace Auto-Layout - Subtask 5

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Subtask:** Phase 5 - WebCola Layouts  
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Session Goals

Implement WebCola force-directed and constraint-based layout algorithms:

1. ⏳ Create ColaForceLayoutAlgorithm (force-directed with natural clustering)
2. ⏳ Create ColaConstrainedLayoutAlgorithm (hierarchical with constraints)
3. ⏳ Register both algorithms in layout registry
4. ⏳ Update UI to show 5 layout options
5. ⏳ Write tests for WebCola algorithms
6. ⏳ Update documentation

---

## Work Log

### Starting Phase 5: WebCola Implementation

**WebCola advantages:**

- Force-directed layout with natural clustering
- Constraint-based positioning (layers, alignment)
- Overlap removal
- Better for complex graphs with many relationships

**Two algorithms to implement:**

1. **ColaForceLayout** - Organic, physics-based positioning
2. **ColaConstrainedLayout** - Hierarchical with layer constraints

## Installing WebCola dependency...

## Phase 5 Progress - Session 1

### Completed ✅

1. ✅ Installed `webcola` dependency (v3.4.0)
2. ✅ Installed `@types/webcola` for TypeScript support
3. ✅ Updated layout-registry to import WebCola algorithms
4. ✅ Updated registry tests to expect 5 algorithms
5. ⚠️ Created WebCola algorithm files (empty - need recreation)

### Files Status

**Need Recreation:**

- `cola-force-layout.ts` - Force-directed layout (file empty, needs content)
- `cola-constrained-layout.ts` - Constraint-based layout (file empty, needs content)
  **Updated:**
- ✅ `layout-registry.ts` - Ready for WebCola algorithms
- ✅ `layout-registry.spec.ts` - Updated to expect 5 algorithms
- ✅ `package.json` - Dependencies installed

### Next Steps

1. Recreate `cola-force-layout.ts` with full WebCola force-directed implementation
2. Recreate `cola-constrained-layout.ts` with constraint-based implementation
3. Run tests to verify registration works
4. Create tests for WebCola algorithms
5. Update documentation

### Algorithm Design (Ready to Implement)

**ColaForceLayoutAlgorithm:**

- Uses webcola.Layout()
- Force-directed with natural clustering
- Overlap removal enabled
- Link distance: 150px default
- Max iterations: 1000
- Respects glued node constraints
  **ColaConstrainedLayoutAlgorithm:**
- Uses webcola.Layout() with layer constraints
- Creates strict hierarchical layers
- Layer gap: 150px, Node gap: 80px
- Flow direction: vertical (y) or horizontal (x)
- Alignment and separation constraints

**Status:** In Progress - Dependencies installed, files need recreation
