# Pull Request: Workspace Auto-Layout Feature

## 🎯 Overview

This PR introduces an **automatic layout feature** for the Workspace view, making it easier to organize and visualize your HiveMQ Edge topology. With one click, you can arrange adapters, bridges, and topics into clear, organized layouts.

---

## ✨ What's New for Users

### Automatic Node Organization

Instead of manually positioning nodes in your workspace, you can now **automatically arrange them** using professional layout algorithms:

- **🌳 Tree Layouts** - Organize nodes in hierarchical structures (vertical or horizontal)
- **🎯 Radial Hub** - Show the Edge broker at the center with connections radiating outward
- **⚡ Force-Directed** - Create balanced, naturally spaced layouts

### Simple Controls

New controls appear at the top of your workspace:

1. **Algorithm Selector** - Choose how you want nodes arranged
2. **Apply Button** - One click to organize your entire workspace
3. **Presets Menu** - Save and reload your favorite layouts
4. **Options** - Fine-tune layout settings to your preference

### Save Your Favorite Layouts

Found a layout you like? Save it as a preset:

- **Quick Save** - Store your current layout with a custom name
- **Quick Load** - Restore any saved layout instantly
- **Multiple Presets** - Keep different layouts for different scenarios

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Power users can apply layouts even faster:

- **⌘+L (Mac)** or **Ctrl+L (Windows/Linux)** - Apply the selected layout algorithm

## 🎨 Visual Improvement

### Before: Manual Positioning

![Workspace Before Layout](../../../cypress/screenshots/workspace-layout-before.png)

Nodes may overlap or be scattered across the canvas, making it hard to understand the topology at a glance.

### After: Automatic Layout (Radial Hub)

![Workspace After Radial Hub Layout](../../../cypress/screenshots/workspace-layout-after-radial-hub.png)

Nodes are automatically organized with the Edge broker at the center, showing clear connections to all adapters and bridges.

## 📋 Key Features

### 1. Multiple Layout Algorithms

Choose the layout that best fits your needs:

| Algorithm                      | Best For                 | Description                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Vertical Tree (Dagre TB)**   | Hierarchical flows       | Top-to-bottom organization    |
| **Horizontal Tree (Dagre LR)** | Wide hierarchies         | Left-to-right organization    |
| **Radial Hub**                 | Hub-and-spoke topologies | Edge broker at center         |
| **Force-Directed (Cola)**      | Balanced spacing         | Natural, physics-based layout |
| **Manual**                     | Custom positioning       | Keep your manual arrangement  |

### 2. Layout Presets

- **Save Current Layout** - Preserve node positions and settings
- **Load Saved Preset** - Restore layouts instantly
- **Delete Presets** - Manage your saved layouts
- **Persistent Storage** - Presets survive browser restarts

### 3. Configurable Options

Each layout algorithm has customizable options:

- **Spacing** - Adjust distance between nodes
- **Direction** - Change flow direction
- **Alignment** - Control node positioning
- **Animation** - Enable smooth transitions (coming soon)

### 4. Keyboard Support

- **⌘+L / Ctrl+L** - Apply current layout
- **Tab Navigation** - Keyboard-accessible controls
- **Screen Reader Support** - Full ARIA labels and roles
