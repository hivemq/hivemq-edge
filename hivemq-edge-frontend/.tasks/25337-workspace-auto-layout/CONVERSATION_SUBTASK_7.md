# Conversation: Task 25337 - Workspace Auto-Layout - Subtask 7

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Subtask:** Bug Fix - Node Dragging Performance  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Issue Description

**Problem:** Significant lag when dragging nodes in the workspace. Nodes visually lag behind the cursor during drag operations.

**Root Cause:** CSS transitions and animations were applied to ALL `.react-flow__node` and `.react-flow__edge` elements globally, causing performance degradation during normal user interactions (dragging, panning, etc.).

**User Impact:** Poor user experience - nodes don't follow cursor smoothly during drag operations.

---

## Technical Analysis

### Original Problematic Code

```css
/* THIS CODE CAUSED THE LAG */

/* Applied to ALL nodes at ALL times */
.react-flow__node {
  transition:
    transform 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1),
    opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

/* Applied to ALL edges at ALL times */
.react-flow__edge {
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

/* Duplicate selector for applying-layout class */
.react-flow__node.applying-layout {
  transition: /* ... */;
}

/* Another duplicate selector */
.react-flow__node.applying-layout {
  animation: layout-pulse 1s ease-in-out;
}
```

### Why This Caused Lag

1. **Global Transitions:** Every node had `transform` transition active at all times
2. **Performance Impact:** During drag, React Flow rapidly updates node positions. With transitions active, the browser had to:
   - Calculate transition frames for EVERY position update
   - Interpolate between old and new positions
   - Apply easing functions continuously
   - Re-render transition states
3. **Cascade Effect:** With multiple nodes and edges, the performance cost multiplied
4. **Visual Lag:** Transitions created a delay between actual position and rendered position

---

## Solution

### Fixed Code

```css
/* Animations ONLY when layout is being applied */
.react-flow__node.applying-layout {
  transition:
    transform 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1),
    opacity 0.5s ease-in-out;
  animation: layout-pulse 1s ease-in-out;
}
```

### Key Changes

1. ✅ **Removed global transitions** from `.react-flow__node`
2. ✅ **Removed global transitions** from `.react-flow__edge`
3. ✅ **Fixed duplicate selector** - merged both `.applying-layout` rules
4. ✅ **Scoped animations** - transitions only active when `.applying-layout` class is present
5. ✅ **Fixed stylelint issues** - proper formatting

### How It Works Now

1. **Normal Operation:** Nodes have NO transitions → instant response to dragging
2. **Layout Application:** `useLayoutEngine` temporarily adds `.applying-layout` class → smooth animated transitions
3. **After Layout:** Class is removed → instant response restored

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/modules/Workspace/components/reactflow-chakra.fix.css`

**Changes:**

- Removed lines 8-12 (global `.react-flow__node` transitions)
- Removed lines 20-22 (global `.react-flow__edge` transitions)
- Merged duplicate `.react-flow__node.applying-layout` selectors
- Fixed formatting and stylelint issues

**Before:** 38 lines  
**After:** 25 lines  
**Net:** -13 lines (removed unnecessary code)

---

## Verification

### Stylelint Check

```bash
npx stylelint "src/modules/Workspace/components/reactflow-chakra.fix.css"
```

**Result:** ✅ No errors

### Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Dragging nodes:** Should be instant and responsive with no lag
2. **Applying layout:** Should still show smooth animated transitions
3. **Edge rendering:** Should update instantly during drag
4. **Overall performance:** Significantly improved

---

## Important Notes

### Why This Bug Occurred

This was the **third time** the user reported this issue. Previous attempts fixed other areas instead of addressing the root cause in the CSS animations.

**Lesson Learned:** When user reports performance issues with dragging:

1. Check for CSS transitions on `.react-flow__node` or `.react-flow__edge`
2. Ensure animations are scoped to specific scenarios (e.g., layout application)
3. Never apply transform/position transitions globally in React Flow

### Best Practices for React Flow Animations

✅ **DO:**

- Apply transitions only with specific classes (`.applying-layout`)
- Remove animation classes after transitions complete
- Test dragging performance after adding any CSS animations

❌ **DON'T:**

- Add global transitions to `.react-flow__node` or `.react-flow__edge`
- Apply transform/position transitions without specific scoping
- Assume CSS transitions won't impact drag performance

---

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

**Fixed Issues:**

1. ✅ Removed global transitions causing drag lag
2. ✅ Fixed duplicate CSS selector
3. ✅ Fixed stylelint formatting issues
4. ✅ Scoped animations to layout application only
5. ✅ Added `applying-layout` class logic in useLayoutEngine

**User Verification Needed:**

- Test node dragging performance in workspace
- Verify layout animations now work when applying layout
- Confirm no visual artifacts or lag

---

## Additional Fix: Animation Class Application

### Issue

After fixing the CSS, the user reported that animations were not being applied during layout. Investigation revealed that the `applying-layout` class was defined in CSS but never actually applied to nodes in the JavaScript code.

### Solution

Modified `useLayoutEngine.ts` to:

1. **Add class before position update**: Apply `applying-layout` class to all nodes to trigger CSS transitions
2. **Update positions**: Apply new positions while class is active (triggers smooth animation)
3. **Remove class after animation**: Clean up class after animation duration completes

### Code Changes

```typescript
// Add applying-layout class to trigger CSS animations
const animationDuration = layoutConfig.options.animate ? layoutConfig.options.animationDuration || 300 : 0

if (animationDuration > 0) {
  // Add class to all nodes
  const addClassChanges = nodes.map((node) => ({
    id: node.id,
    type: 'replace' as const,
    item: {
      ...node,
      className: `${node.className || ''} applying-layout`.trim(),
    },
  }))
  onNodesChange(addClassChanges)
}

// Update nodes with new positions (animated if class is present)
const changes = result.nodes.map((node) => ({
  id: node.id,
  type: 'position' as const,
  position: node.position,
  // ...
}))
onNodesChange(changes)

// Remove applying-layout class after animation completes
if (animationDuration > 0) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const removeClassChanges = nodes.map((node) => ({
      id: node.id,
      type: 'replace' as const,
      item: {
        ...node,
        className: (node.className || '').replace('applying-layout', '').trim(),
      },
    }))
    onNodesChange(removeClassChanges)
  }, animationDuration)
}
```

### Flow

1. User clicks "Apply Layout" → `animate: true`, `animationDuration: 500ms`
2. Hook adds `applying-layout` class to all nodes
3. CSS transitions activate: `transition: transform 0.5s ...`
4. Hook updates node positions → smooth animated movement
5. After 500ms, hook removes `applying-layout` class
6. CSS transitions deactivate → instant response for dragging

### Result

- ✅ Smooth animations during layout application
- ✅ No performance impact during normal dragging
- ✅ Proper cleanup after animation completes

---

## Final Fix: Inline Styles Instead of CSS Classes

### Issue #3 - User Testing

After implementing the class-based animation, user tested with animation on/off and reported **no transition was visible**.

### Root Cause Analysis

React Flow's `className` property on node objects **does NOT apply to the `.react-flow__node` wrapper element**. It applies to the inner content wrapper only. Therefore, our CSS selector `.react-flow__node.applying-layout` never matched anything.

### Final Working Solution

Switched from CSS classes to **inline styles** applied directly to node objects:

```typescript
// Add inline transition style
const addStyleChanges = currentNodes.map((node) => ({
  id: node.id,
  type: 'replace' as const,
  item: {
    ...node,
    style: {
      ...node.style,
      transition: `transform ${animationDuration}ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`,
    },
  },
}))
onNodesChange(addStyleChanges)

// Wait for next frame, then update positions
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  const changes = result.nodes.map((node) => ({ ... }))
  onNodesChange(changes)

  // Remove transition style after animation
  setTimeout(() => {
    const removeStyleChanges = finalNodes.map((node) => {
      const { transition, ...restStyle } = node.style || {}
      return { id: node.id, type: 'replace', item: { ...node, style: restStyle } }
    })
    onNodesChange(removeStyleChanges)
  }, animationDuration)
})
```

### Why This Works

- ✅ Inline styles apply directly to `.react-flow__node` wrapper element
- ✅ No dependency on CSS class matching
- ✅ Transition added → positions updated → transition removed
- ✅ Clean timing with `requestAnimationFrame()`

### CSS Cleanup

Removed all the unused `.applying-layout` CSS code since we're using inline styles:

```css
/* BEFORE: 33 lines with unused animation code */

/* AFTER: Clean minimal file */
.react-flow__panel {
  margin: 0;
}
```
