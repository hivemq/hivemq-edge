# Pull Request: Enhanced Workspace Status Visualization

**Kanban Ticket:** https://businessmap.io/c/57/32118

---

## Description

This PR transforms how users understand the state of their data transformation pipelines in the HiveMQ Edge Workspace. Previously, users could only see if nodes were connected or disconnected. Now, users can instantly see both **runtime status** (is it connected?) and **operational status** (is it configured?) through intuitive visual feedback.

The enhancement introduces:

- **Color-coded connection states**: Green = running, Red = error, Yellow = stopped
- **Animated edges for configured paths**: Flowing dots indicate data transformations are ready to work
- **Per-connection feedback**: Each data path shows its own configuration state independently
- **Instant problem detection**: Immediately see which paths need configuration attention

### User Experience Improvements

**What users gain:**

- **At-a-glance status understanding**: No need to click into nodes to check configuration
- **Clear visual language**: Color shows runtime state, animation shows configuration completeness
- **Faster troubleshooting**: Immediately identify which connections need attention
- **Reduced configuration errors**: Visual feedback prevents incomplete setups
- **Confidence in deployment**: See that all paths are both connected AND configured before going live

### Technical Summary

**Implementation highlights:**

- Integrated dual-status model across all 10 workspace node types
- Implemented 8 per-edge operational status rules for accurate feedback
- Migrated to React Flow's efficient hooks for better performance
- Added 74+ comprehensive tests (unit, component, and E2E)
- Full documentation in workspace topology reference

## BEFORE

### Previous Behavior - Limited Status Information

The old implementation only showed basic connection status:

**Limitations:**

- Only runtime status visible (connected vs disconnected)
- No indication if data transformations were configured
- All edges to the same target looked identical
- Users had to manually check each node to verify configuration
- No visual distinction between "connected but not configured" and "fully operational"
- Difficult to spot incomplete configurations at scale

_Example: All edges appear the same regardless of configuration state_

## AFTER

### New Behavior - Rich Visual Feedback

The new implementation provides comprehensive status visualization with two dimensions:

#### 1. Workspace with Mixed Status States

When viewing a complex workspace with various configuration states:

![After - Workspace Overview](./screenshots/workspace-after-overview.png)

_Test: Captured from Cypress E2E test `workspace-pr-screenshots.spec.cy.ts`_  
_Screenshot: 1400x1016 viewport showing multiple node types and connection states_

**Key Visual Elements:**

- **Green nodes with animated edges**: Fully operational (connected AND configured)
- **Green nodes with static edges**: Connected but missing configuration
- **Yellow nodes**: Stopped or inactive
- **Red nodes**: Error state requiring attention

**User Benefits:**

- Immediate identification of incomplete configurations
- Clear visual hierarchy of operational vs non-operational paths
- Easy to spot which connections need attention
- Confidence that animated paths are ready for production

#### 2. Per-Edge Configuration Status

Different edges to the same target show independent status:

![After - Per-Edge Status](./screenshots/workspace-after-per-edge.png)

_Example: Adapter connected to multiple combiners, each showing its own configuration state_

**Visual Feedback:**

- **Adapter ‚Üí Combiner 1** (animated): This combiner has mappings configured ‚úÖ
- **Adapter ‚Üí Combiner 2** (not animated): This combiner needs mapping configuration ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Combiner 1 ‚Üí Edge** (animated): Operational path ready for data flow ‚úÖ

**User Benefit:** Precise feedback about which specific data transformation paths are configured, not just overall node status

#### 3. Pulse Asset Mapper Validation

Special handling for Pulse integration showing valid vs invalid mappings:

- **Pulse ‚Üí Asset Mapper 1** (animated): Mapper references valid, mapped Pulse assets ‚úÖ
- **Pulse ‚Üí Asset Mapper 2** (not animated): Mapper references unmapped assets or has no mappings ‚ö†Ô∏è

**User Benefit:** Immediate visibility into which asset mappers are properly configured with valid Pulse assets

## Visual Language Guide

### What the Colors Mean

| Color         | Meaning                            | User Action                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| üü¢ **Green**  | Node is connected and running      | ‚úÖ Good - continue            |
| üî¥ **Red**    | Node has errors or failed to start | ‚ùå Fix errors immediately     |
| üü° **Yellow** | Node is stopped or disconnected    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Check why it's not running |

### What Animation Means

| Animation           | Meaning                                        | User Action             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ‚ö° **Flowing dots** | Data transformation is configured              | ‚úÖ Ready for production |
| üö´ **No animation** | Missing configuration (mappings, topics, etc.) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Add configuration    |

### Combined Status Examples

| Visual                      | Meaning                           | Next Steps                    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| üü¢ Green + ‚ö° Animated      | Perfect! Connected and configured | ‚úÖ No action needed           |
| üü¢ Green + üö´ Not animated  | Connected but needs configuration | ‚ö†Ô∏è Add mappings or topics     |
| üî¥ Red (any animation)      | Error state - fix first           | ‚ùå Resolve errors             |
| üü° Yellow + üö´ Not animated | Stopped and may need config       | ‚ö†Ô∏è Start node, then configure |

## Reviewer Notes

**Focus areas for review:**

1. **UX/Visual**: Verify the visual language is intuitive and clear
2. **Edge cases**: Test with complex workspaces (many nodes, multiple combiners)
3. **Performance**: Validate smooth rendering with large graphs
4. **Documentation**: Review topology reference for completeness

**Manual testing suggestions:**

1. Create an adapter with tags
2. Connect to multiple combiners
3. Add mappings to only one combiner
4. Observe: One edge animates, others don't ‚úÖ
5. Add mappings to second combiner
6. Observe: Second edge now animates ‚úÖ

**Quick test commands:**

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run E2E workspace tests
pnpm test:cy:e2e -- --spec "cypress/e2e/workspace/*.spec.cy.ts"

# Check for compilation errors
pnpm type-check
```
