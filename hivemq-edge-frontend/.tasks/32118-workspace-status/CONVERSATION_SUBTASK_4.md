**Reviewed `NodeGroup.tsx` implementation:**

- Found that status aggregation was already implemented in Phase 5
- Uses React Flow's `useNodesData()` for efficient child tracking
- Aggregates both runtime and operational status
- Follows priority: ERROR > ACTIVE > INACTIVE

#### 3. Created Comprehensive Group Node Tests

**Created Unit Tests (`group-status.spec.ts`)** - 17 new tests:

1. **Single Level Groups - Mixed Child Statuses (5 tests)**

   - Aggregate ACTIVE when all children ACTIVE
   - Aggregate ERROR when any child has ERROR
   - Aggregate INACTIVE when no child is ACTIVE/ERROR
   - Mixed ACTIVE and INACTIVE → ACTIVE
   - Prioritize ERROR over ACTIVE

2. **Operational Status Aggregation (3 tests)**

   - Aggregate ACTIVE operational when all configured
   - Aggregate ERROR operational when any has config error
   - Aggregate INACTIVE when not fully configured

3. **Nested Groups (2 tests)**

   - Aggregate status from nested group children
   - Handle deeply nested hierarchies (3+ levels)

4. **Edge Cases (4 tests)**

   - Empty child list → INACTIVE
   - Children without statusModel → INACTIVE
   - Single child group → inherit child status
   - Mixed node types (adapters, bridges, devices)

5. **Status Priority Rules (1 test)**

   - Verify ERROR > ACTIVE > INACTIVE priority

6. **Real-world Scenarios (2 tests)**
   - Warehouse monitoring with mixed sensor states
   - Multi-site bridge group with offline site

**Test Results:**

- ✅ All 17 tests passing
- ✅ Duration: 4ms
- ✅ Zero errors

#### 4. Created Cypress E2E Tests

**Created `workspace-group-nodes.spec.cy.ts`** with comprehensive coverage:

1. **Group Node Status Aggregation (3 tests)**

   - Display ERROR when any child has ERROR
   - Display ACTIVE when all children ACTIVE
   - Update group status when child status changes

2. **Group Node Expand/Collapse (3 tests)**

   - Expand group to show child nodes
   - Collapse group to hide child nodes
   - Maintain status aggregation when collapsed

## Success Criteria Verification

All success criteria have been met:

✅ **All node types have `statusModel` in their data**

- Active nodes: Adapter, Bridge, Pulse
- Passive nodes: Device, Host, Edge, Combiner, Assets, Listener
- Group nodes: Cluster/Group with aggregated status

✅ **Runtime status correctly maps from original statuses**

- `mapAdapterStatusToRuntime()` for adapters/bridges
- `mapPulseStatusToRuntime()` for pulse nodes
- Comprehensive mapping tests (28 tests)

✅ **Passive nodes derive status from upstream connections**

- `computePassiveNodeStatus()` implemented
- All passive nodes use React Flow's hooks for derivation
- Integration tests verify propagation (13 tests)

✅ **Operational status reflects configuration state**

- Adapters check north/south mappings
- Bridges check topic filters
- Combiners check input/output configs

## Technical Insights

### Group Status Aggregation Algorithm

The algorithm in `NodeGroup.tsx` follows a simple priority-based approach:

```typescript
// Priority: ERROR > ACTIVE > INACTIVE
const runtime = hasErrorRuntime ? RuntimeStatus.ERROR : hasActiveRuntime ? RuntimeStatus.ACTIVE : RuntimeStatus.INACTIVE
```

**Why this works:**

- **ERROR priority**: If ANY child has an issue, the group should indicate a problem
- **ACTIVE presence**: If at least one child is working, the group is partially operational
- **INACTIVE fallback**: Only when all children are inactive or no status exists

### React Flow Optimization

Using `useNodesData(childrenNodeIds)` provides:

- **Selective subscriptions**: Only re-renders when specified child nodes change
- **Built-in memoization**: React Flow handles caching internally
- **No manual tracking**: No need for custom state management
- **Performance**: O(1) lookup for child node data

### Nested Group Handling

Nested groups work naturally because:

- Each group computes its own `statusModel`
- Parent groups read child group's `statusModel` like any other node
- Status propagates bottom-up through the hierarchy
- No special handling needed for arbitrary nesting depth
