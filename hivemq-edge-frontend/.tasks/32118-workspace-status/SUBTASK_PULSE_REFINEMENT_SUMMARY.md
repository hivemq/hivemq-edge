# Task 32118 - Workspace Status: Subtask Summary

## Subtask: Pulse Agent Operational Status Refinement

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## What Was Done

### Problem

The initial Pulse Agent operational status implementation (Phase 4) was too simplistic. It only checked if the Pulse agent had mapped assets, without considering whether those assets were actually being used in downstream data transformations.

### Solution

Implemented fine-grained operational status logic that checks if connected Asset Mapper (combiner) nodes have mappings that reference valid Pulse assets.

### Key Changes

#### 1. New Utilities (`edge-operational-status.utils.ts`)

- `combinerHasValidPulseAssetMappings()` - Validates combiner mappings
- `computePulseToAssetMapperOperationalStatus()` - Per-edge status (future use)
- `computePulseNodeOperationalStatus()` - Overall Pulse node status

#### 2. Updated NodePulse Component

- Uses React Flow's `useNodeConnections()` for efficient connection tracking
- Uses `useNodesData()` to get connected combiner data
- Recomputes operational status based on actual asset usage in mappers

#### 3. Test Coverage

- Created 15 comprehensive unit tests
- All tests passing ✅
- Coverage includes edge cases and error scenarios

## Technical Details

### Before (Simplified Logic)

```typescript
const hasMappedAssets = assetStats.mapped > 0
const operational = hasMappedAssets ? ACTIVE : INACTIVE
```

### After (Fine-Grained Logic)

```typescript
const validCombiners = connectedNodes.filter((node) => node !== null)
const operational = computePulseNodeOperationalStatus(validCombiners, allAssets.items)
```

### Status Determination

A Pulse agent is now **OPERATIONAL (ACTIVE)** if:

1. It has at least one outbound connection to an asset mapper
2. That asset mapper has at least one mapping configured
3. The mapping references a valid asset ID
4. The referenced asset is in MAPPED status (not UNMAPPED)

## Files

### Created

- `src/modules/Workspace/utils/edge-operational-status.utils.ts` (108 lines)
- `src/modules/Workspace/utils/edge-operational-status.utils.spec.ts` (425 lines)
- `.tasks/32118-workspace-status/CONVERSATION_SUBTASK_PULSE_REFINEMENT.md` (documentation)

### Modified

- `src/modules/Workspace/components/nodes/NodePulse.tsx` (status computation)

---

## Test Results

```
✓ 15 tests passing
  ✓ 7 tests for combinerHasValidPulseAssetMappings
  ✓ 5 tests for computePulseToAssetMapperOperationalStatus
  ✓ 3 tests for computePulseNodeOperationalStatus
```

**No compilation errors** ✅  
**All workspace utils tests still passing** ✅

---

## Benefits

1. **More Accurate Status** - Reflects actual data flow topology
2. **Better User Feedback** - Users can see which Pulse agents are actually being used
3. **Future-Ready** - `computePulseToAssetMapperOperationalStatus()` enables per-edge status visualization
4. **Performance Optimized** - Uses React Flow's efficient hooks for minimal re-renders
5. **Well-Tested** - Comprehensive test coverage with 15 unit tests

---

## Next Steps (Future Work)

### Per-Edge Status Visualization

The foundation is laid for showing operational status on individual edges:

- Different colors for operational vs. non-operational connections
- Tooltips explaining why a connection is inactive
- Visual indicators showing which asset mapper has valid mappings

### Edge Data Extension

Could extend edge data structure:

```typescript
type EdgeWithStatus = Edge<{
  operationalStatus: OperationalStatus
  validMappings: number
  invalidMappings: number
}>
```

### Status Caching

For large graphs:

- Debounced computation
- Per-combiner result caching
- Incremental updates

---

## Integration Notes

This subtask builds on the Phase 4 operational status work and integrates seamlessly with:

- ✅ Unified status model (RuntimeStatus + OperationalStatus)
- ✅ React Flow node data storage
- ✅ StatusListener edge rendering
- ✅ Existing NodeCombiner operational logic

---

## Conclusion

Successfully refined the Pulse Agent operational status to account for actual asset usage in downstream transformations. The implementation is efficient, well-tested, and ready for future enhancements.

**Key Insight:** A Pulse agent should only be considered operational if its assets are actually being used in mappings, not just if they exist and are mapped.
