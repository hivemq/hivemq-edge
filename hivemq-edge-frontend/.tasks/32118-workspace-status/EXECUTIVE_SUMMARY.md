# Executive Summary: Task 32118 - Workspace Status Enhancement

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - READY FOR PRODUCTION  
**Confidence Level:** 🟢 HIGH

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

A comprehensive **dual-status model with per-edge operational status** for the HiveMQ Edge Workspace, providing users with clear, accurate visual feedback about:

1. **Runtime Status** - Is the system running and connected? (Node color)
2. **Operational Status** - Is the system configured correctly? (Edge animation)

---

## 💼 Business Impact

### Problem Solved

**Before:** Users couldn't tell if data transformation paths were properly configured. All edges looked the same regardless of configuration state.

**After:** Users get immediate visual feedback:

- 🟢 Green animated edge = Active and configured ✅
- 🟢 Green non-animated edge = Active but not configured ⚠️
- 🔴 Red edge = Error state ❌
- 🟡 Yellow edge = Inactive/disconnected 📴

### User Benefits

✅ **Immediate Problem Detection** - See configuration issues at a glance  
✅ **Clear Visual Language** - Color + animation = complete status picture  
✅ **Per-Connection Feedback** - Each data path shows its own state  
✅ **Reduced Configuration Time** - Quickly identify what needs attention  
✅ **Better Troubleshooting** - Visual debugging of data flows
