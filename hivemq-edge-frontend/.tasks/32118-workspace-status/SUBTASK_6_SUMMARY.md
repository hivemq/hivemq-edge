# Subtask 6 Summary: Operational Status Bug Fixes

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date**: October 26, 2025

## Quick Overview

Fixed two critical bugs in workspace status computation:

### Bug 1: Wrong Operational Status Logic

**Problem**: Bidirectional adapters with only northbound OR only southbound mappings showed as INACTIVE  
**Solution**: Changed logic from AND to OR - adapter is ACTIVE if it has ANY mappings configured

### Bug 2: No Edge Status Propagation

**Problem**: Edge animations didn't update based on operational status  
**Solution**: Added useEffect hook to update edge animation based on mapping types:

- ADAPTER → EDGE: animated when has northbound mappings
- ADAPTER → DEVICE: animated when has southbound mappings

## Files Changed

1. `src/modules/Workspace/components/nodes/NodeAdapter.tsx` - Modified

   - Fixed operational status computation
   - Added edge status propagation logic
   - Added required imports

2. `src/modules/Workspace/components/nodes/NodeAdapter.operational-status.spec.ts` - Created
   - 17 comprehensive unit tests
   - All passing ✅

## Key Code Changes

```typescript
// OLD (Bug):
const operational =
  hasNorthMappings && (!isBidirectionalAdapter || hasSouthMappings)
    ? OperationalStatus.ACTIVE
    : OperationalStatus.INACTIVE

// NEW (Fixed):
const operational =
  hasNorthMappings || (isBidirectionalAdapter && hasSouthMappings)
    ? OperationalStatus.ACTIVE
    : OperationalStatus.INACTIVE
```

## Test Results

```bash
✅ 17/17 new unit tests passing
✅ 28/28 existing status tests passing
✅ No regressions detected
```

## Impact

- ✅ Correct status computation for all adapter types
- ✅ Edges animate only when operationally active
- ✅ Efficient React Flow integration
- ✅ Future-proof for MAPPER/COMBINER work
