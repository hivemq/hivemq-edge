# Pulse Agent Operational Status Refinement - Quick Reference

## What Changed

### Old Behavior ❌

Pulse agent was OPERATIONAL if it had **any** mapped assets

### New Behavior ✅

Pulse agent is OPERATIONAL if at least one **connected asset mapper** has **mappings referencing valid assets**

---

## Why This Matters

The old logic didn't reflect the actual data flow:

- Assets could be mapped but never used in any transformations
- Pulse agent would show as operational even though no data was flowing
- Users couldn't tell if their asset mappers were properly configured

The new logic ensures:

- ✅ Pulse agent status reflects actual usage in the topology
- ✅ Asset mappers must reference valid (MAPPED) assets
- ✅ Broken or incomplete configurations are clearly indicated

---

## Implementation

### 3 New Functions

1. **`combinerHasValidPulseAssetMappings(combiner, assets)`**

   - Checks if a combiner has mappings referencing valid Pulse assets
   - Returns `true` only if asset is MAPPED (not UNMAPPED)

2. **`computePulseToAssetMapperOperationalStatus(pulseNode, combinerNode, assets)`**

   - Computes status for a specific Pulse → Asset Mapper edge
   - Returns ACTIVE, INACTIVE, or ERROR
   - Ready for per-edge status visualization (future work)

3. **`computePulseNodeOperationalStatus(combiners, assets)`**
   - Computes overall Pulse node operational status
   - Returns ACTIVE if at least one connected combiner is valid
   - Used by NodePulse component

### Updated Component

**NodePulse.tsx** now:

- Tracks outbound connections with `useNodeConnections()`
- Gets combiner data with `useNodesData()`
- Computes operational status based on actual asset usage
- Automatically updates when connections or assets change

---

## Test Coverage

### 15 Unit Tests ✅

- 7 tests for `combinerHasValidPulseAssetMappings`
- 5 tests for `computePulseToAssetMapperOperationalStatus`
- 3 tests for `computePulseNodeOperationalStatus`

All tests passing, no compilation errors.

## Performance

- ✅ Uses React Flow's optimized hooks (`useNodeConnections`, `useNodesData`)
- ✅ Memoized with `useMemo()` - only recomputes when dependencies change
- ✅ No unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ Works efficiently with large graphs (100+ nodes tested)

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Asset Mappers

```
Pulse Agent (has 5 mapped assets)
  └─[no connections]

Status: INACTIVE ❌
Reason: No asset mappers connected
```

### Scenario 2: Asset Mapper with No Mappings

```
Pulse Agent (has 5 mapped assets)
  └─> Asset Mapper (no mappings configured)

Status: INACTIVE ❌
Reason: Asset mapper has no mappings
```

### Scenario 3: Asset Mapper Referencing Unmapped Asset

```
Pulse Agent (has 5 mapped assets)
  └─> Asset Mapper
       └─ Mapping 1 → Asset "temp-sensor" (UNMAPPED)

Status: INACTIVE ❌
Reason: Referenced asset is not mapped
```

### Scenario 4: Valid Configuration ✅

```
Pulse Agent (has 5 mapped assets)
  └─> Asset Mapper
       └─ Mapping 1 → Asset "temp-sensor" (MAPPED) ✅

Status: ACTIVE ✅
Reason: At least one mapping references a valid asset
```

### Scenario 5: Multiple Asset Mappers (Mixed)

```
Pulse Agent (has 5 mapped assets)
  ├─> Asset Mapper 1 (no mappings) ❌
  └─> Asset Mapper 2
       └─ Mapping 1 → Asset "pressure-sensor" (MAPPED) ✅

Status: ACTIVE ✅
Reason: At least one mapper has valid configuration
```

## Future Enhancements

### Per-Edge Status Visualization

Function already exists: `computePulseToAssetMapperOperationalStatus()`

Could enable:

- Different colors per edge (operational vs. non-operational)
- Tooltips showing why an edge is inactive
- Visual indicators for which mappers are configured correctly

### Status Caching

For very large graphs:

- Cache per-combiner results
- Debounce expensive computations
- Incremental updates on single mapping changes

---

## Quick Checklist for Similar Refinements

When adding fine-grained status for other node types:

- [ ] Identify the actual data flow dependencies
- [ ] Create specific validation functions (like `combinerHasValidPulseAssetMappings`)
- [ ] Implement per-node status computation (like `computePulseNodeOperationalStatus`)
- [ ] Consider per-edge status for future visualization
- [ ] Use React Flow's optimized hooks for connections
- [ ] Memoize expensive computations
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests (edge cases!)
- [ ] Document the logic and reasoning
