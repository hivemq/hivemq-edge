## Unified Workspace Toolbar: Search, Filter, and Layout Controls Together

### What It Is

The workspace now features a single, collapsible toolbar that brings search, filter, and layout controls together in one convenient location at the top-left of your canvas. Instead of hunting across multiple toolbars, you'll find all your workspace organization tools in one place.

The toolbar has two logical sections:

- **Search & Filter** - Find entities quickly and apply custom filters to show only what you need
- **Layout Controls** - Organize your workspace with automatic layout algorithms and manage saved configurations

### How It Works

1. **Expand the toolbar** by clicking the expand button at the top-left of the canvas to reveal all controls
2. **Search for entities** using the search input to quickly find adapters, bridges, or other nodes by name
3. **Apply filters** to hide unwanted nodes—click the filter button to open the filter drawer and narrow your view
4. **Select a layout algorithm** from the dropdown menu to automatically organize your workspace
5. **Click Apply Layout** to reorganize your nodes instantly
6. **Manage presets** to save and reuse your favorite layout configurations
7. **Collapse the toolbar** when you want to maximize your canvas space—the toolbar shrinks to a compact icon

All controls respond instantly, and smooth animations keep the workspace feeling responsive. Your expanded/collapsed preference is remembered between sessions.

### How It Helps

#### Find What You Need Faster

Search across all your workspace entities in seconds. Type a name or pattern, and the toolbar instantly filters your view to show only matching nodes. No more scrolling through a crowded canvas.

#### Control Your View with Smart Filtering

Combine search with powerful filters to focus on specific entity types, statuses, or connection patterns. See your entire data flow without visual clutter.

#### Organize Intelligently in One Click

Apply workspace layouts without context switching. Try different organization patterns—vertical flow, horizontal layout, force-directed clustering, or radial hub—all accessible from the same toolbar.

#### Maximize Your Canvas Space

Collapse the toolbar when you're focused on designing or analyzing. The toolbar shrinks to a minimal footer, giving you more screen real estate for your workspace while keeping controls just a click away.

### Looking Ahead

The unified toolbar creates a foundation for future enhancements. We're considering adding quick-access presets, layout recommendations based on your topology, and combined search-filter operations. Your workflow feedback will shape how we evolve this feature.
