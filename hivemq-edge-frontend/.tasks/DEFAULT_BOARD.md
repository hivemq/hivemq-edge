# Default Board Configuration

## Primary Board for HiveMQ Edge Frontend

**Board Name:** Edge  
**Board ID:** 57  
**Workspace ID:** 3  
**Status:** Active  

## Related Boards

- **Edge Backlog** (ID: 67) - For backlog items and future planning
- **QA** (ID: 48) - For quality assurance tasks related to Edge

## Why This Board?

This board is designated as the default for AI assistant operations because:
1. **Project Alignment** - Matches the HiveMQ Edge Frontend project context
2. **Active Development** - Currently active and maintained
3. **Team Focus** - Primary board for Edge team work

## Usage in AI Context

When you ask questions without specifying a board, the AI will assume you mean the **Edge board (ID: 57)**. For example:

- "What tasks are in progress?" → Queries Edge board
- "Show me my cards" → Filters Edge board for your assignments
- "What's in the backlog?" → Queries Edge Backlog board (ID: 67)

## Override Default

To query a different board, simply specify it:
- "What's in the Broker Feature board?"
- "Show cards from QA board"
- "List tasks in Platform board"

## Board Access

You have access to all 23 boards across the HiveMQ BusinessMap workspace. The Edge board is simply the default context for this project's work.
