# Task 37696 - Criteria Disabled State Testing: Summary

## Completed Work

Successfully added disabled state tests to all filter criteria components in the Workspace module.

## Components Updated

All 6 components now have comprehensive disabled state testing:

1. **WrapperCriteria.spec.cy.tsx** ✅
   - Added test: "should render properly when disabled"
   - Verifies switch is disabled and doesn't trigger onChange on forced clicks

2. **FilterEntities.spec.cy.tsx** ✅
   - Added test: "should render properly when disabled"
   - Verifies select input has aria-disabled attribute
   - Confirms dropdown doesn't open and onChange is not called

3. **FilterProtocol.spec.cy.tsx** ✅
   - Added test: "should render properly when disabled"
   - Verifies select input has aria-disabled attribute
   - Confirms dropdown doesn't open and onChange is not called

4. **FilterSelection.spec.cy.tsx** ✅
   - Added test: "should render properly when disabled"
   - Verifies both action buttons are disabled
   - Confirms onChange is not called on forced clicks

5. **FilterStatus.spec.cy.tsx** ✅
   - Added test: "should render properly when disabled"
   - Verifies select input has aria-disabled attribute
   - Confirms dropdown doesn't open and onChange is not called

6. **FilterTopics.spec.cy.tsx** ✅
   - Added test: "should render properly when disabled"
   - Verifies select input has aria-disabled attribute
   - Confirms dropdown doesn't open and onChange is not called

## Test Pattern

Each disabled state test follows the existing test patterns:
- Mounts the component with `isDisabled` prop set to true
- Verifies disabled UI state (aria attributes, button states)
- Attempts interactions with `{ force: true }` to ensure they're truly blocked
- Confirms `onChange` callback is never invoked

## Code Quality

- ✅ ESLint passed with no errors
- ✅ Prettier formatting applied (all files already properly formatted)
- ✅ No modifications made to existing tests
- ✅ All new tests follow existing patterns and conventions

## Test Coverage Summary

- **Total files modified:** 6
- **Code quality checks:** All passing
- **Existing tests:** Preserved without modification

## Status

**COMPLETED** - October 23, 2025

All disabled state tests have been successfully added to the filter criteria components. The tests verify that:
1. Disabled components render with appropriate accessibility attributes
2. User interactions are properly prevented
3. Callback functions are not invoked when components are disabled
4. Visual state correctly reflects the disabled condition
