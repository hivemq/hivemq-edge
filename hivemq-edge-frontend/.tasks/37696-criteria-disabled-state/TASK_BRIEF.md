# Task 37696: Criteria Disabled State Testing

## Overview

Add comprehensive Cypress tests for the disabled state of filter criteria components in the Workspace module.

## Components to Test

1. `WrapperCriteria.tsx` - Wrapper component with disabled state
2. `FilterEntities.tsx` - Entity filter with disabled state
3. `FilterProtocol.tsx` - Protocol filter with disabled state
4. `FilterSelection.tsx` - Selection filter with disabled state
5. `FilterStatus.tsx` - Status filter with disabled state
6. `FilterTopics.tsx` - Topics filter with disabled state

## Requirements

- Add tests for disabled state to existing Cypress test files
- Use existing tests as templates
- Do not modify existing tests
- Ensure all tests pass
- Apply ESLint and Prettier to changed files

## Test Coverage Goals

Each component should have tests that verify:

- Component renders correctly when disabled
- User interactions are prevented when disabled
- Appropriate ARIA attributes are present
- Visual state reflects disabled condition
