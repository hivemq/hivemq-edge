== HiveMQ Edge

image:https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/hivemq/hivemq-edge/check.yml?branch=master[GitHub Workflow Status (with branch),link=https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-edge/actions/workflows/check.yml?query=branch%3Amaster]

HiveMQ Edge is an open-source, modular, secure by design platform which consolidates industrial workloads, unifying them into open-standards MQTT to connect to the enterprise.
Seamlessly defining UNS by deployment, using targeted data model & transformation plugins, allows IT and OT to unify and ‘control by policy’, data collected at the Edge.

It is a Java-based open source MQTT and MQTT-SN broker that fully supports MQTT 3.x,5 and MQTT-SN 1.2.

=== MQTT Broker

HiveMQ Edge incorporates a fully standards compliant MQTT broker.
Connect your devices to the broker to subscribe and gain access to data obtained from devices on the Edge.

HiveMQ Edge is compatible with all MQTT 3.x and MQTT 5 clients, including Eclipse Paho and https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-mqtt-client[HiveMQ MQTT Client].

=== MQTT-SN Gateway

HiveMQ Edge incorporates an MQTT-SN gateway allowing constrained devices to access the MQTT broker.

MQTT-SN is an optimized version of the MQTT specification designed for use on small, low powered, sensor devices, often running on the edge of the network; typical of the IoT.

=== Protocol Adapters

A protocol adapter contributes code to connect to PLCs and converts the data retrieved from these devices into MQTT messages which are PUBLISHED into the local MQTT broker.
More Protocol adapters will be added to the project over time.

* OPC UA
* Modbus
* S7
* ADS
* HTTP
* Allen-Bradley footnoteref:[tba]
* and many more


=== MQTT Bridging

HiveMQ allows you to backhaul your data into an enterprise broker using MQTT bridges.
Connect any number of bridges to transport Edge data upstream. By connecting Edge to enterprise MQTT brokers like https://www.hivemq.com/[HiveMQ] you can build a flexible https://www.hivemq.com/unified-namespace-uns-essentials-iiot-industry-40/[Unified Namespace (UNS)] solution based on open standards.

== How to Use

=== Quick Start

* Download the latest https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-edge/releases/download/2023.9/hivemq-edge-2023.9.zip[HiveMQ Edge binary package].
* Unzip the package.
* Run the run.sh (Linux/OSX) or run.bat (Windows) in the bin folder of the package.

[source,bash]
----
cd hivemq-edge-<version>
bin/run.sh
----

[IMPORTANT]
At least Java version 11 is required to run HiveMQ Edge.
If you are in doubt, you can check the installed Java version by entering `java -version` on your command line.

You can now connect MQTT clients to `<ip address>:1883`.

[CAUTION]
If you want to connect devices on external networks to HiveMQ Edge, please make sure your server is reachable from those networks and the required ports (default: 1883) are accessible through your firewall.

=== Run with Docker

All releases are available in the https://hub.docker.com/r/hivemq/hivemq-edge[hivemq/hivemq-edge] repository on DockerHub.
To execute this image, simply run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --name hivemq-edge -d -p 1883:1883 -p 8080:8080 hivemq/hivemq-edge
----

When the container is running you can connect MQTT clients at port 1883 and access the UI at http://localhost:8080/.

Default credentials for the UI are user: `admin`, password: `hivemq`


To run the current state of `master` branch instead of the latest released version you can use the `snapshot` tag.
----
docker run --name hivemq-edge -p 1883:1883 -p 8080:8080 hivemq/hivemq-edge:snapshot
----


To change the default log level you can set the environment variable `HIVEMQ_LOG_LEVEL` when running the container:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --name hivemq-edge -e HIVEMQ_LOG_LEVEL=INFO -d -p 1883:1883 -p 8080:8080 hivemq/hivemq-edge

----
