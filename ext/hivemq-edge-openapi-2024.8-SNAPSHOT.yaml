    # Introduction
    HiveMQ Edge's REST API provides endpoints for the following use cases:
    - Authentication
    - Health Checking
    - Exploring Configuration
    ## Errors
    Conventional HTTP response codes are used to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Codes in the 2xx range generally indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error on the server side.
    For all errors a JSON response with additional details is returned in the format [Problem JSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807).
    ## OpenAPI
    HiveMQ's REST API provides an OpenAPI 3.0 schema definition that can imported into popular API tooling (e.g. Postman) or can be used to generate client-code for multiple programming languages.

    Policies describe how you want the HiveMQ broker to validate the behavior of MQTT clients.
    Each policy has four sections:

    - Matching: Specifies which clients the policy engine validates.
    - Deserialization: Specifies deserializers for different message payloads.
    - Behavior: Specifies the behavior that is considered valid for matched clients.
    - onTransitions: Specifies custom actions that are executed when a client transitions to a different state within the specified behavior model that is valid for that client.
    These endpoints can be used to create, update, delete, and list behavior policies.

    For more information on all capabilities the HiveMQ Data Hub offers, see the [HiveMQ documentation](https://docs.hivemq.com/hivemq/latest/data-hub/index.html).

    Data Policies describe how you want the HiveMQ broker to apply schemas to incoming MQTT message payload data and act on the validation results.
    Each policy has four sections:

    - Matching: Specifies which packets the policy engine validates.
    - Validation: Specifies how the packets are validated. For example, based on a JSON Schema.
    - OnSuccess: Defines which actions are executed when the outcome of a validation is successful.
    - OnFailure: Defines which actions are executed when the validation fails.

    These endpoints can be used to create, update, delete, and list data policies.

    For more information on all capabilities the HiveMQ Data Hub offers, see the [HiveMQ documentation](https://docs.hivemq.com/hivemq/latest/data-hub/index.html).

    A schema defines the expected structure and format of incoming MQTT message payload data.

    This endpoint can be used to create, get, and delete schemas.

    Schemas can be enforced with the use of a policy.

    Currently, the following schema definitions are supported:

    - [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)
    - [Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)](https://protobuf.dev/)

    For more information on how to define and use a schema in HiveMQ, see [Schemas](https://docs.hivemq.com/hivemq/latest/data-hub/schemas.html).

    A script represents custom logic that can be executed in response to MQTT messages.

    This endpoint can be used to create, get, and delete scripts.
